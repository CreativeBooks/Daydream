# Daydream
This Project is called 'Three Knives Deep' and was made for Daydream Charlotte, over the course of 13 hours. We used Godot Engine and Gdscript for this project, with Pixilart and Canva for the iamges and backgrounds. 

We struggled mostly with GDScript because of how none of us knew the language and since all of us were inexperienced with Godot 2D. It took a lot of trial and error with the more complex bits. Our project deals with sacrifice as this was the theme for our Daydream event. We chose to create a game that involves murder because that was one of the first things that came to mind when we heard the word sacrifice.
