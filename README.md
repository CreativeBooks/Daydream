# Daydream
This Project is called 'Three Knives Deep' and was made for Daydream Charlotte, over the course of 13 hours. We used Godot Engine and Gdscript for this prject, with Pixilart and Canva for the iamges and backgrounds. We struggled with the code at points, as this one one of the first times we used Godot to make a project.
